# RCS provisioning template

This application connects to the provisioning server and saves the device configuration into a template under the SDCARD.<br>
This template (named "/sdcard/provisioning_template.xml") can be used to provision the RCS core stack manually (even for other MSISDNs).<br>
Requirement: you must have a valid SIM card to interface the provisioning server.
